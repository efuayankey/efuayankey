# Hey, I'm Efua Yankey

I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student at Lehigh University, exploring the intersection of machine learning, quant modeling, and software systems that actually make sense.

I've led dev teams, contributed to research, and built tools that people still use — across wellness, education, and decision-making spaces. I care about clean systems, clear thinking, and tech that feels human.

Leadership, to me, means building **with** people, not just for them. I’m especially drawn to work that lives at the intersection of **deep tech and real-world impact** — whether that’s through quant research, software engineering, or thoughtful AI.
