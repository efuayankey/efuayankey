## Heyyy there, Efua here!

I’m a Computer Science & Engineering student at Lehigh University with a focus on machine learning, quantitative modeling, and systems that are designed to work (and make sense).

I’ve led dev teams, contributed to research, and built tools people still use across wellness, education, and decision-making. I care about clean systems, clear thinking, and building tech that feels intuitive and human.

Right now, I’m especially interested in work that sits at the intersection of deep technology and measurable impact, including quant research, scalable software engineering, and applied AI.
