# Efua Yankey

I’m studying Computer Science & Engineering at Lehigh, and I’m into machine learning, AI, quant modeling, and building things that actually work (and make sense).

I’ve led dev teams, worked on research, and built tools people still use — in wellness, education, and everyday decisions. I care about clean systems, clear thinking, and tech that feels human.

Right now, I’m especially excited about work that sits at the intersection of deep tech and real impact — quant, SWE, and research all fit that space for me.
